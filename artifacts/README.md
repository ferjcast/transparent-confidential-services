# Attestation Artifacts

This directory aggregates the canonical payloads referenced in the paper to illustrate the confidential attestation flow. The JSON files capture both sides of the protocol: evidence emitted by the Evidence Provider (inside the CVM) and the attestation results returned by the Evidence Verifier. Hosting these payloads alongside the codebase gives readers a concrete view of the artifacts described in the Attestation Evidence and Attestation Result sections of the framework.

## Purpose

- Document the exact field structure of each evidence type (attestation quote, workload metadata, infrastructure metadata) as produced by the running prototype.
- Demonstrate how the Verifier expresses pass and failure conditions for the three evidence appraisal endpoints.
- Provide reproducible fixtures that developers can replay when extending or auditing the framework.

## Directory Overview

- `attestation-evidence/` - Evidence payloads returned by the in-CVM Evidence Provider service.
- `attestation-result/` - Result payloads emitted by the Evidence Verifier endpoints for the same session inputs.

## Evidence Bundles (`attestation-evidence/`)

The Evidence Provider exposes dedicated endpoints for each artifact, and the corresponding JSON responses are mirrored here:

- `attestation-quote-evidence.json` - Hardware-backed Intel TDX quote that binds the session nonce (`reportData`) to the launch measurements (`mrTd`, `mrSeam`, `rtmrs`, `tdAttributes`, `teeTcbSvn`, `xfam`).
- `workload-evidence.json` - Container inventory with digests, runtime state, and provenance labels collected directly from the Docker engine for workload integrity checks.
- `infrastructure-metadata-evidence.json` - Cloud context describing the CVM (instance type, region, shielding status) and boot disk lineage so the verifier can trace the machine back to the published baseline manifest.

These payloads map 1:1 to the Attestation Evidence presented in the paper and can be replayed against the Verifier for regression testing.

## Verification Results (`attestation-result/`)

Each subdirectory captures responses from the Verifier's REST endpoints and includes both success and representative failure cases:

- `quote-attestation-result/` - Validates quote authenticity, endorsement chains, and nonce freshness. Contains `pass.json` plus failure scenarios such as `fail-mrTd-mismatch.json` and `fail-nonce-mismatch.json`.
- `workload-attestation-result/` - Confirms container digests against the Reference Value Provider, illustrating how provenance mismatches are surfaced.
- `infrastructure-metadata-attestation-result/` - Checks VM configuration and boot disk metadata against the baseline manifest, demonstrating how deviations are reported.

The result payloads align with the Attestation Result description in the paper and show exactly what a relying application would receive when invoking the verifier endpoints.
