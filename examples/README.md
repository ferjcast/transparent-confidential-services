# Examples Directory

This directory contains example payloads generated by the `evidenceprovider` and `evidenceverifier` services within the Attestify framework. These files are intended to illustrate the structure and contents of key artifacts exchanged during the remote attestation flow.

## Purpose

Each file in this folder represents a representative JSON payload produced or consumed by a component of the system:

- `evidenceprovider/`: Contains raw attestation evidence retrieved from the Attester VM, including workload metadata, TDX attestation quotes, and infrastructure configuration.
- `evidenceverifier/`: Contains attestation results issued by the Verifier after evaluating evidence against reference values and appraisal policies.

These examples serve as a reference for developers, researchers, or auditors who want to understand the format, scope, and semantics of the data exchanged during attestation in the context of the Attestify framework.

## Usage

You can use these examples to:

- Explore how evidence artifacts are structured
- Test the Verifier's implementation using representative inputs
- Understand how attestation results are derived and formatted
